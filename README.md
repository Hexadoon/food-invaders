## Overview
Meal Invaders is a fixed shooter game that takes inspiration from games like Touhou 7 and Space Invaders. There will be 3 levels based on breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as various weapons and power ups, so the player will face multiple themed enemies and the scariest boss: the human. Each enemy will be allotted a certain number of points and players will attempt to obtain the most points possible within their three lives. The game is over when the player runs out of lives or defeats all three bosses.
